# Data Types
### Character
  - Used to specify a character or character string.
  - Use single quotes for a character (e.g., 'A') or double quotes for a character string (e.g., "Apple").

### Int 
  - Specifies whole numbers.
  - Use the suffix "L" to specify integer data (e.g., 123L).

### Numeric
  - Represents all real numbers with or without a decimal point (e.g., 125 or 125.0).

### Complex
  - Represents numeric values with an imaginary part. The suffix "i" is used to specify the imaginary part (e.g., x <- 2 + 3i).

### Logical
  - A Boolean data type that takes values TRUE or FALSE.

### Raw (Real Numbers)
  - Represents all real numbers.

### Vector
  - A set of values with the same type (a collection of ordered elements) represented in a one-dimensional array.
  - The `c()` function is used to concatenate multiple elements together into a single vector.

### Matrix
  - R objects in which the elements are arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout, and the elements are of the same atomic type.

### List
  - Flexible R objects with irregular or non-rectangular data structures.
  - Lists may contain vectors, matrices, or other lists.

### Data Frame
  - A data frame may be regarded as a matrix with columns possibly of differing modes and attributes. It can be displayed in matrix form, and its rows and columns can be extracted using matrix indexing conventions.

### Factor
  - A categorical variable that stores both string and integer values as levels.
  - Factors are commonly used in statistical modeling and exploratory data analysis with R.
